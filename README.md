# Integrating Semantic Directions with Concept Mover's Distance: Reproduction Guide

This repository contains all R code and data necessary to reproduce our analyses in our "Integrating Semantic Directions with Concept Mover's Distance to Measure Binary Concept Engagement." It is a short note follow-up to our *Journal of Computational Social Science* paper ([Stoltz and Taylor 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42001-019-00048-6)), "Concept Mover's Distance: Measuring Concept Engagement via Word Embeddings in Texts."

In the the original *JCSS* paper, we put forth a method for measuring concept engagement in texts that uses word embeddings to find the minimum cost necessary for words in an observed document to "travel" to words in a pseudo-document---a document consisting only of words denoting a concept of interest. One potential limitation with our method is that words associated with opposing concepts will be located close to one another in the underlying embedding space, meaning that a document's closeness to one concept will likely have similar closeness to a starkly opposing concept (e.g., "life" and "death"). In this short note, we propose a method for dealing with this "binary concept problem" in CMD by incorporating recent work on word embeddings in cultural sociology. Using aggregate word vector differences, referred to as semantic directions---or **cultural dimensions** (["The Geometry of Culture," *American Sociological Review*, 2019](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0003122419877135))---we illustrate how CMD can be used to measure a document's engagement with binary concepts.

To reproduce the figures and regression models in the paper, download all scripts and CSVs to a local folder, and load the packages in the 1_prep_functions.R script. The remaining scripts are self-contained, and refer to the respective section of the note. Some of the figures require downloading text from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) which may take some time. Note also that our `CMDist` function has been updated to include cultural dimensions; as such, you will need to update the package to the most recent version ([0.4.1](https://github.com/dustinstoltz/CMDist) as of March 25, 2020) in order to replicate the analyses.
